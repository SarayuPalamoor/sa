Jenkins will check GitHub every 5 minutes for new commits.

Step 6: Test Trigger

Make a small change in your repo, e.g., edit README.md.

Push the change to GitHub:

git add README.md
git commit -m "Test Poll SCM build trigger"
git push origin main


Wait up to 5 minutes.

Step 7: Verify Build

Go to Jenkins → Your job → Build History → A new build should appear.

Click on the latest build → Console Output.

You should see Maven running, ending with:

[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
