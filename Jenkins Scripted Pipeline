Step 1 — Create a new Freestyle Project

On the Jenkins dashboard, click “New Item” (top-left).

Enter a name for your project, e.g., mavenjavaproject.

Select “Freestyle project”.

Click OK.

Step 2 — Connect to your GitHub repo

Scroll to Source Code Management → Git.

In Repository URL, paste your GitHub repo URL (e.g., https://github.com/SarayuPalamoor/mavenjavaproject).

If it’s a private repo, click Add → Jenkins under Credentials → enter your GitHub username and personal access token → Add.

Leave Branch Specifier as */main (or */master if your repo uses master).

Step 3 — Configure Maven build

Scroll to Build → Add build step → Invoke top-level Maven targets.

Maven Version: select the one you configured earlier (e.g., Maven3).

Goals: type:

clean package


This tells Maven to clean the previous build and package your project into a JAR.

Step 5 — Save and build

Click Save at the bottom.

On the project page, click Build Now (left-hand menu).

A new build will appear in Build History.

Click the #1 build → Console Output to see the Maven build logs.

Step 6 — Verify the build

After a successful build, scroll to Last Successful Artifacts → target/

You should see your .jar file (e.g., PreethikaJava-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar).
