STEP 1 — Open Jenkins and your pipeline

Open your web browser.

Go to your Jenkins URL (something like http://localhost:8080/).

Log in with your Jenkins username and password.

Find your project/pipeline in the list (for example: Maven-Pipeline-Demo) and click on it.

Why: We need a pipeline ready so GitHub can trigger it.
STEP 2 — Make sure the GitHub plugin is installed in Jenkins

On the Jenkins homepage, click Manage Jenkins.

Click Manage Plugins.

Go to the Installed tab and see if GitHub plugin is listed.

If it’s not, go to the Available tab → search GitHub plugin → click Install without restart.

Wait for installation to finish.

Why: Jenkins needs this plugin to listen to GitHub webhooks.
STEP 3 — Configure your Jenkins pipeline to accept webhooks

Click on your pipeline/project name → Configure.

Scroll down to Build Triggers.

Check “GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling”.

Click Save at the bottom.

Why: This allows Jenkins to start a build automatically when GitHub notifies it.
Open your GitHub repo

Open your browser → go to github.com → log in.

Open the repository you want Jenkins to build (for example: jenkins-maven-demo).
Add a webhook in GitHub

On your repo page → click Settings (top-right).

Click Webhooks (left menu) → click Add webhook.

Payload URL → type:

http://YOUR_JENKINS_URL/github-webhook/


Example: http://localhost:8080/github-webhook/ if Jenkins is local.

Content type → select application/json.

Which events would you like to trigger this webhook? → select Just the push event.

Click Add webhook.

Why: This tells GitHub to “ping” Jenkins every time you push code.
STEP 7 — Watch Jenkins automatically start the build

Go back to Jenkins → open your pipeline/project.

On the Build History (left side), you should see a new build starting automatically.

Click the build number → click Console Output.

You should see your build running and ending with:

BUILD SUCCESS


This proves the webhook worked.
